    "Brokerage APIs often provide live price data on option chains - prices of call & put contracts at different strikes - along with prices of the underlying equity, quoted at the time of the query. While stocks' share price history - open/close/high/low/volume by day, week, or desired period - is widely available from brokerage APIs and even websites such as Yahoo! Finance and polygon.io, the same is not true for historical option prices. In this project, I created an automated API query and storage pipeline for option-chain prices, with the intention of acquiring granular price data for different machine learning models to inform trading decisions and improve returns."

    "The Python script (get_quotes.py) is executed by Python by the crontab utility every minute for eight hours (0900-1659) spanning NYSE market hours (0930-1600). The TD Ameritrade API permits up to 60 queries per second; neither throttling nor bans were encountered during data acquisition. However, the API log-in seems to time out after 15 minutes, requiring manually logging in via a web browser. Future work will automate this log-in using Selenium."

Percentage moves in prices are color-coded; red indicates loss, as usual; green indicates gain, and transitions to blue as appreciation exceeds 100%. Generally, calls (up-arrows) appreciate in value when the share price increases, while puts (down-arrows) lose value; the inverse is true when the underlying price decreases.  \n",

Later-expiring contracts also appreciate/depreciate with the trend, but as expected, do not react as strongly to daily price movements."
