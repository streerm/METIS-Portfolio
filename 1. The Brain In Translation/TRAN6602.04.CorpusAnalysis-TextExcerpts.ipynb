      "-  Moreover, the previously reported modulation of the L. F3op/F3t activation by scrambling word orders can be consistently explained by DoM, because scrambling requires “movements” of NPs to higher nodes by applying more Merge operations, thus increasing DoM. The size of linguistic constituents also correlates with DoM, especially when the number of left/right branches was increased as in the case of Pallier et al. (2011).\n",

      "-  Collectively these results suggest that the sense of voluntary control of movement may critically depend on the functional coupling of SMA with motor systems, and provide a potential neural basis for the narrowing of awareness reported in pathological and culturally influenced dissociative phenomena.\n",
      "-  Schizophrenia, focal epilepsy and right parietal lobe lesions are associated with the related but distinct condition of ‘alien control’, in which the patient reports that their actions are not generated by themselves but by a force or entity outside the self [1,2].\n",
      "-  Involuntary movements associated with narrowing or loss of awareness also occur in culturally-influenced dissociative phenomena linked to spirit possession, mediumship, and shamanism, which have been widely reported across different cultures and periods of history [5-9].\n",
      "-  The SMA is active both before the onset and during movements subjectively reported to be self-initiated or controlled.\n",
      "-  Consequently, reduced activation of SMA or reduced functional connectivity with other regions involved in action implementation (such as premotor cortex, M1, S1, and cerebellum) are likely candidates for mediating the loss of perceived voluntary control following attributions of self-generated actions to a source other than the self – as occurs in association with pathological and culturally influenced dissociative phenomena, delusions of alien control, or suggestions of involuntary movement.. Also, as far as we are aware no previous studies have combined suggestion and neuroimaging to explicitly examine the neural correlates of suggested involuntary movement accompanied by loss of awareness (to model symptoms and experiences reported by patients experiencing psychogenic non-epileptic seizures or culturally influenced dissociative states [8,9]).. We predicted that reduction in subjective awareness of involuntary movements would be associated with reduced activation of superior parietal cortex (BA 7), a brain region involved in the integration of somatosensory and visual information during visuomotor coordination of hand movements, in addition to a more general awareness of the bodily self [23,24].\n",

The suggestion that a participant’s hand would move “all by itself” (hyp-involA) as compared to it moving voluntarily (hyp-vol) was associated with significantly reduced ratings of control t(10)= 5.17; p<0.001 and ownership t(10)= 4.04; p=0.002.\n",
      "-  There was no difference in awareness ratings for the hyp-involA condition t(10)= 0.971; p=0.355. When it was suggested, “you will not be aware of your hand or its movements…” (hyp-involNA vs hyp-involA), participants reported significant reductions in feelings of awareness (t(10)= 3.65; p=0.004), control (t(10)= 3.19; p=0.010) and ownership (t(10)= 3.28; p<0.001).\n",
      "-  This suggests that subtle and non-significant reductions in joystick movements (and any changes in proprioceptive feedback associated with such reductions) could not explain the differences in brain activity between involuntary movement with and without awareness that we report.. We predicted that suggested involuntary movement would be associated with reduced functional connectivity between key regions involved in motor planning (SMA) and implementation (M1).\n",
      "-  In summary, the current experimental model is relevant to understanding different forms of psychopathological and culturally influenced alterations of control, ownership, and awareness of limb movement when viewed in relation to the distinctive features of each phenomenon.. The present experiment employed targeted suggestions and fMRI to investigate reduction of awareness of limb movement as reported in some psychopathological and culturally sanctioned dissociative phenomena.\n",
