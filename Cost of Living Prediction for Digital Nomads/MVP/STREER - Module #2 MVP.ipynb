    "### Motivation:\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to capture how cost of living in cities around the world is influenced by their population, location, key prices such as rent and transportation, and country-level features such as GDP. The clientele of the resulting model is digital nomads wishing to estimate their expenses before relocating to a city, especially ones 'off the beaten path'.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology:\n",
    "\n",
    "Expatistan is a website hosting crowd-source price data in cities around the world for various goods and services. City is the unit of analysis: after scraping all cities and their URLs [from a summary page](https://www.expatistan.com/cost-of-living/all-cities), price data were scraped from individual cities whose data was provided by 10+ contributors, yielding 1200+ cities. NaN values were replaced with country means or that failing, subregion means.\n",
    "\n",
    "* City-level features (population, lat/lng, is_capital): [SimpleMap.com](https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities)\n",
    "* City-level features (climate): Derived from lat/lng data; checked against [Koppen-Geiger classification map](http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/present.htm)\n",
    "* Country-level features (GDP per capita (nominal), GDP per capita (PPP), Human Development Index (HDI): Respective Wikipedia pages, \"Region\" and \"Subregion\" included in tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, certain prices expected **and demonstrated** to correlate strongly with cost-of-living are introduced into the model (despite strong collinearity, and the fact that price data is used by Expatistan to calculate their own estimates). For example, the rent of a studio apartment, a cup of coffee, taxi rides, etc."
